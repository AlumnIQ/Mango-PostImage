# PostImage Plugin for Mango Blog

Inspired by Medium.com, this is a plugin that requires you to provide an image url for every post. You can then, in your theme (not included here) get the post image and display it however you like.

This is the interface provided for providing your post image:

The plugin does come with one setting: `required`, and if set to true, this is the error shown when you don't provide an image before attempting to publish:

When `required` is false, or saving a post as a draft, you are not required to include a post image.
